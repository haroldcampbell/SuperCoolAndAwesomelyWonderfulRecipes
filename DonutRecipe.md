## Recipe

There are two parts to this recipe. A section for making the dough, and another for making the glaze or sugar sprinkle.
The thing that makes this recipe so easy is that you don't need any special ingredients.

### Ingredients

#### Dough Ingredients

- 1/4 cup **warm** (not boiling) water
- 1 packet dry yeast
- 3/4 cup **warm** milk
- 35 grams soft butter or margarine (it doesn't matter if it is salted)
- 2 tbsp sugar (I used brown sugar)
- 1 egg
- 2 cups flour
- 1/8 tsp salt (optional)
- 1/8 tsp nutmeg (optional)

#### Glaze Ingredients

- 1 cup powdered sugar
- 3 tbsp water
- between 28 to 35 grams of soft butter or margarine
- 1/4 tsp vanilla
- 1/8 tsp almond essence

### Preparations

For this recipe, start with the dough as it takes just a few minutes to create the glaze.

#### Dough Preparations

1. Combine all the ingredients in a large bowl.
2. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let the combined dough sit for an hour (at room temperature). Tip, you can
put it outside in the sun :)
3. After the hour, and the yeast has caused the dough to rise, knead the dough for about 5 minutes.
4. Let the dough sit for an additional 30 minutes.
5. Now the dough is ready.
  1. Lightly flour your working area so that the dough doesn't stick.
  2. Roll the dough to about 1/4 inch thick (or the size of a regular pencil. We don't want to dough to be too flat).
  3. Cut the donuts to size. For this you can use a large tea/coffee cup to cut the donuts, and soda bottle cover to
  cut the donut holes.
6. (More waiting) Let the cut donuts sit (again at room temperature) for about 15 to 30 minutes before baking.

#### Glaze Preparations

1. Add all the ingredients.
2. Microwave until warm or the butter has melted.
3. Stir until the sugar dissolves.
