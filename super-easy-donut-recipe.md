## Recipe

There are two parts to this recipe. A section for making the dough, and another for making the glaze.

### Ingredients

The thing that makes this recipe so easy is that you don't need any special ingredients.

##### Dough Ingredients

- 1/4 cup **warm** (not boiling) water
- 1 packet dry yeast
- 3/4 cup **warm** milk
- 35 grams soft butter or margarine (it doesn't matter if it is salted)
- 2 tbsp sugar (I used brown sugar)
- 1 egg
- 2 cups flour
- 1/8 tsp salt (optional)
- 1/8 tsp nutmeg (optional)

##### Glaze Ingredients

- 1 cup powdered sugar
- 3 tbsp water
- between 28 to 35 grams of soft butter or margarine
- 1/4 tsp vanilla
- 1/8 tsp almond essence

### Preparations

For this recipe, start with the dough as it takes just a few minutes to create the glaze.

##### Dough Preparations

1. Combine all the **dough ingredients** ingredients in a large bowl.
2. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let the combined dough sit for 1 hour (at room temperature). **Tip:** you can put the dough outside in the sun, just ensure that the cloth is very damp :)
3. (After the hour) knead the dough for about 5 minutes.
4. Let the dough sit for an additional 30 minutes.
5. Now the dough is ready.
  1. Lightly flour your working area so that the dough doesn't stick.
  2. Roll the dough until it's about 1/4 inch thick (or the size of a regular pencil. We don't want to dough to be
  too flat).
  3. Cut the donuts to size. For this you can use a large tea/coffee cup to cut the donuts, and soda bottle cover to
  cut the donut holes.
6. (More waiting) Let the cut donuts sit (again at room temperature) for about 15 to 30 minutes before frying.

##### Glaze Preparations

**Tip:** I have found that it is best to make the glaze after **Step 6** of the **Dough Preparations** above.

1. Add all the **glaze ingredients** ingredients to a wide bowl.
2. Microwave until warm or the butter has melted **Tip:** do not over heat!
3. Stir until the sugar dissolves.

### Cooking instructions

1. We will be deep frying these treats so you will need about 1 1/4 inch of oil in a medium-sized sauce pan.
2. Fry only 3 at a time over a medium to high flame.
3. The cooking time for the donuts is about 30 seconds (15 on each side).
4. Flip the donuts once they have gone golden brown (or after 15 seconds).
5. Take the donut out of the pan and let the excess oil drain. **Tip:** I placed mine one a large plate that had a two sheets of paper towels to absorb the excess oil.
6. After about 3 - 5 minutes, dip in glaze.
7. **Enjoy**!
